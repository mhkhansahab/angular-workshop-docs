description: Integrating TailwindCSS with the Angular App
---

You can read the guidelines of how to integrate Tailwind CSS with Angular from the [official docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/angular). 
You can skip the first step, since we already have an Angular application created.

Once done, we can clean up the view in the `app.component.html` file, and write down the following HTML to test installation.

```html
<div class="text-xl font-bold">
  Hello World!
</div>
```

We recommend using this [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) (in case you use VS Code of course) to have a great developer experience with Tailwind CSS
